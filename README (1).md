 POE Part 2 â€“ EcoFuture SA Website
My name is Boitumelo Baba. ST10447349
This is Part 2 of my Portfolio of Evidence (POE) project for EcoFuture SA, a non-profit organisation based in Johannesburg. In Part 1, I created a project proposal that outlined the purpose of the website, its goals, features, and design approach.

Part 2 focuses on designing the visuals of the website by applying CSS styling and ensuring the design is responsive across different devices.


All HTML pages are linked to one external CSS file (`css/style.css`) for consistency.

Home, About, Projects, Blog, Contact
Hero banner, impact numbers, call-to-action buttons
Blog section for climate education
Volunteer forms and event calendar
Responsive layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile

Screenshots of the site across devices are included in the _images folder.


I tested responsiveness using browser dev tools for desktop, tablet, and mobile views. Buttons, forms, images, and text scale correctly.

The website is visually consistent, responsive, and ready for submission.
